* James Green, age 46, is an associate professor in the computer science department at Community College of Philadelphia. He is teaching “Introduction to Computer Network and Communication” course which targets students in lower-class (freshman and sophomore). The primary goal of this course is to teach the basic structure of the Internet and how the communication works. As a part of their education, he wants students to visually learn the structure of the Internet and how webpages are connected each other. He is interested in using an open-source web application called Url-Map for his class because it can easily visualize the URL tree map to explore how webpages are connected and expanded from one particular page. This application also has high extensibility so he can add necessary features if needed.

Donald Potterman is a pottery maker from Paris, Tennessee. He is 42 years old and has 8 children and likes to breed frogs in his free time. He is looking to start a website that will primarily be used to sell his works, but he thinks he’d also like to blog about the potter lifestyle. He might also want to include things about frogs and breeding them. He thinks he might also want to write about the Haitian revolution. Donald isn’t really sure what his website will be yet. 


He has a high school education, and isn’t very tech-literate. 
Thanks to URL-Map’s user-friendly interface, Mr. Potterman is able to easily visualize how his website looks and works.
