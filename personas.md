Donald Potterman is a pottery maker from Paris, Tennessee. He is 42 years old and has 8 children and likes to breed frogs in his free time. He is looking to start a website that will primarily be used to sell his works, but he thinks he’d also like to blog about the potter lifestyle. He might also want to include things about frogs and breeding them. He thinks he might also want to write about the Haitian revolution. Donald isn’t really sure what his website will be yet. 


He has a high school education, and isn’t very tech-literate. 
Thanks to URL-Map’s user-friendly interface, Mr. Potterman is able to easily visualize how his website looks and works.

Brian, age 60, is a small business owner living in Doylestown PA, due to his age, he is not very tech savvy but due to the recent economy, he can’t afford to pay someone to build his website for him. Because of this, when Brian is building his website, he sometimes sloppily forgets to delete links to pages or leaves sensitive information is some of the files he has linked to his website. Brian uses Url-Map to show him if he has made any errors in his website design so that he can fix which pages map to where and to allow him to make sure he hasn’t revealed any sensitive data on any pages.
