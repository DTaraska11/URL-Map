Donald Potterman is a pottery maker from Paris, Tennessee. He is 42 years old and has 8 children and likes to breed frogs in his free time. He is looking to start a website that will primarily be used to sell his works, but he thinks he’d also like to blog about the potter lifestyle. He might also want to include things about frogs and breeding them. He thinks he might also want to write about the Haitian revolution. Donald isn’t really sure what his website will be yet. 


He has a high school education, and isn’t very tech-literate. 
Thanks to URL-Map’s user-friendly interface, Mr. Potterman is able to easily visualize how his website looks and works.
