* James Green, age 46, is an associate professor in the computer science department at Community College of Philadelphia. He is teaching “Introduction to Computer Network and Communication” course which targets students in lower-class (freshman and sophomore). The primary goal of this course is to teach the basic structure of the Internet and how the communication works. As a part of their education, he wants students to visually learn the structure of the Internet and how webpages are connected each other. He is interested in using an open-source web application called Url-Map for his class because it can easily visualize the URL tree map to explore how webpages are connected and expanded from one particular page. This application also has high extensibility so he can add necessary features if needed.
