Jack age 51, is a business owner in New York City. He is CEO of his shoe company, loves fashion and keeps up with the latest trends. He was born in NYC where he was raised by his mother who was an international supermodel and held a big influence in the fashion industry. He graduated from NYU as a business major with a minor in entrepreneurship and innovation. He is educated and big pictured oriented and needs to be able to capture the entire site with all his shoes in one place in one diagram. He likes to keep track of everything in his business as he designs a lot of different shoes and loves applications that are organized and efficient.

Donald Potterman is a pottery maker from Paris, Tennessee. He is 42 years old and has 8 children and likes to breed frogs in his free time. He is looking to start a website that will primarily be used to sell his works, but he thinks he’d also like to blog about the potter lifestyle. He might also want to include things about frogs and breeding them. He thinks he might also want to write about the Haitian revolution. Donald isn’t really sure what his website will be yet. 


He has a high school education, and isn’t very tech-literate. 
Thanks to URL-Map’s user-friendly interface, Mr. Potterman is able to easily visualize how his website looks and works.
